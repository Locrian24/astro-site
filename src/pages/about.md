My interests encompass ideas within statistical learning theory and applied machine learning. Particularly within the field of few-shot learning, I'd like to research methods for improving the fast adaptivity of control models even while under stochastic settings. Applications of this research could range from better techniques for renewable energy adoption within smaller power grids, or improved portfolio optimisation strategies.

I have a Combined Computer Science and Math BSc from [University of Victoria](https://uvic.ca). During my degree, I was able to complete projects on applications of machine learning in fields like [bioinformatics](), or [personal health](). I also developed more recreational interests in fields like financial mathematics and quantum information theory, in addition to my primary focus in statistical learning theory.
